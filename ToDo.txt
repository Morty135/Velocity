add more movement mechanics

maybe use pointers to the player pos in the collider rectangle
add collision rectangle to the collision resolution

using pointers may fix the jitter from the previous versions

maybe do the collisions using one point in the middle and set any rectangle bellow as the mininmum height
same for the walls just set the maximum X to the closest wall intersecting
